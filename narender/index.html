        <p>A world where everything you can dream of can be true, a world filled with magic,
             innovation and the strongest warriors. This is the story about a world which was divided into three kingdoms each of them were living in harmony and peace but nothing lasts forever, 
             soon the world ran into chaos after an individual chose to take revenge on those who were the reason for his tragic life, family and now he holds nothing but grudges against them. 
             With the ambition in his heart to conquer the whole world, he’ll do everything to achieve his goals but little did he know that he was just a pawn in someone’s story. Darkness was 
             lingering in the depths within his kingdom.</p>
